					You can rate everything from laundromats to legal firms. It&apos;s
					about time we rated landlords.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
					We know that tenants are often in the dark when it comes to renting
					with a new landlord. Our mission is to create a platform where tenants
					can rate their landlords so others can access this information when
					making their housing decisions.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
					We believe that landlords should be held accountable for their
					services, just like any other business. Tenants have the right to know
					what it&apos;s like to rent from a potential landlord. By sharing
					rental experiences, tenants can help others avoid situations of
					negligence or mistreatment.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
					Share your experiences, read the reviews, and help us keep one another
					safe, informed, and empowered.
