			"p-1": "We know that tenants are often in the dark when it comes to renting with a new landlord. Our mission is to create a platform where tenants can rate their landlords so others can access this information when making their housing decisions.",
			"p-2": "We believe that landlords should be held accountable for their services, just like any other business. Tenants have the right to know what it&apos;s like to rent from a potential landlord. By sharing rental experiences, tenants can help others avoid situations of negligence or mistreatment.",
			"p-3": "Share your experiences, read the reviews, and help us keep one another safe, informed, and empowered."
